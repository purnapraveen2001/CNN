Facial emotions or expressions can be recognized by computers and enhancing modern day
machines to understand human emotions from their real life time.Through this project, i want to
provide solution for real face expressions or emotions by video capture from emotion detector
frame by Open-CV it will capture video by camera which is built-in to the machine or computer
system. . The facial features are identified by different operations provided by OpenCV and the
region consisting of parts of the face are made to surround or enclose by a contour. This region,
enclosed by the contour is used as an input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).The
CNN model created consists of six activation layers, of which four are convolution layers and
two are fully controlled layers.The scope of the project is to
demonstrate the accuracy and validation of Convolution Neural Network(CNN).
